<p>
Here at the University of Sheffield we are developing tools to improve personalised medicine, and as part of this the use of social media data. The scikic app is a testbed which will allow us to investigate what this data can contribute to personalised health, and demonstrate to the user how data can be integrated in this way. It will also provide entertaining and potentially useful insights to the user.
</p>
<p>
The scikic uses data that you provide to produce these insights that you might find entertaining or useful. It uses data you've given in answer to the questions it's asked, and from any services you've allowed it access to (facebook, spotify, etc).
</p>
<p>
The insights the scikic generates are not guaranteed to be correct. You don't have to answer any questions you don't want to and you can decide to have all your data that you've added to the scikic deleted at any time.
