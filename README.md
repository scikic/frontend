Online psychic: Runs on a webserver.

==To install==

1) clone the repo to a cgi folder
2) alter config.py to point to a location the script can keep some data (needs to be accessible if running as apache).
3) run python setup.py to download and create all the files that it requires. This can take a LONG LONG time.
